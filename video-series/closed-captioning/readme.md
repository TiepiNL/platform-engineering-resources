# Subtitles

This are the subtitles as added to the YouTube videos in the Platform Engineering series.

Followed steps to create them:

1. Write down full text.
2. Use AI voice model (ElevenLabs) based on my own voice to create the video audio.
3. Use [Buzz](https://github.com/chidiwilliams/buzz) to transcribe the audio offline with OpenAI's Whisper.
4. Use [SubtitleEdit](https://github.com/SubtitleEdit/subtitleedit) to optimize.
