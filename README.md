# Platform Engineering Resources

## Intro

Welcome! This repository contains a curated list of references and resources used in my **Platform Engineering series** videos ([YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhTFKjucJxnmtZTmRXC__uOQYOG3AB7Vd)).

### About This Series

Platform Engineering is still a new concept for many teams and organizations. This video series is my way of helping my own organization ánd the wider community gaining a clear understanding of the principles and benefits of Platform Engineering.

The series covers:
